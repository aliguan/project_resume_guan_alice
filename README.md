## Resources
1. [jQuery #1: Lazy Line Printer](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/svg-path-animation-with-jquery-and-illustrator)
    - I used this jQuery plugin to trace icons that I made in Illustrator on my resume site. [Lazy Line Painter](http://lazylinepainter.info/) converts the SVG files into paths that jQuery can trace. Once I link the minified js in my index.html, I can call the 'paint' function to trace the icons into whatever div I have selected.

2. [jQuery #2: ToolTipster](http://iamceege.github.io/tooltipster/)
    - I used this plugin to expand on my work and school experience on my resume. When hovering over a ID that I specified in the JS, content pops up that I specified as a string. Linking the js to my site allows it to call the tooltipster function and show hidden content in a pop up.

3. [Skill Bars](http://cssdeck.com/labs/animated-responsive-skills-bar)

4. [Vertical Line in Between Divs](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13221416/how-to-create-100-vertical-line-in-css)
